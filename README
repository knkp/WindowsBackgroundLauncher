I recently had my linux computer stolen and I really miss having shortcuts to launch things like terminals and what-not.
So I figured I'd write a tool that runs in the background and I can define what I want it to do with a config file (not implemented yet)

If you want to mess with the code - I'm using visual studio 2012 for this particular project,
enjoy!


USEAGE:
press "+" and "s" in quick procession to launch a windows command shell

TODO:
add support for defining hot-keys to file
